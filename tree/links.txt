please read the link below for doubts in c and c++ related to pointer and reference:-

remember that C is has no concept of passs by reference, passing pointers is kind of vague since its that we passing a pointer to a reference not the reference itself. C++ supports the same. hence void func(int& x) possible in C++.

reference refers to address of varible hence any change made will be reflected in address and all the varibles associated with that address.

pointer points to a particular address which can be made to point to a different location.
